# Plan to Implement LightGBM from Scratch

## Overview
LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine) is a fast, distributed, high-performance gradient boosting framework based on decision tree algorithms. Implementing LightGBM from scratch involves understanding its core components and how they interact to build an efficient boosting system.

## Components and Their Usage

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Usage:** Prepare and bin the data for efficient histogram-based splitting.
- **Tasks:**
  - Handle missing values
  - Feature binning (discretization)
  - Efficient data storage

### 2. Decision Tree Learner
- **Usage:** Build decision trees using histogram-based algorithms.
- **Tasks:**
  - Histogram construction for features
  - Find best split using histograms
  - Leaf-wise (best-first) tree growth
  - Support for categorical features

### 3. Gradient Boosting Framework
- **Usage:** Iteratively train trees to minimize the loss function.
- **Tasks:**
  - Compute gradients and hessians for each sample
  - Update predictions after each tree
  - Aggregate results from all trees

### 4. Loss Functions
- **Usage:** Measure the error and compute gradients/hessians.
- **Tasks:**
  - Implement loss functions (e.g., MSE for regression, Logloss for classification)
  - Provide gradient and hessian calculations

### 5. Regularization and Pruning
- **Usage:** Prevent overfitting and control model complexity.
- **Tasks:**
  - Tree depth limitation
  - Minimum data in leaf
  - L1/L2 regularization

### 6. Prediction and Inference
- **Usage:** Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.
- **Tasks:**
  - Aggregate outputs from all trees
  - Apply sigmoid/softmax for classification

### 7. Additional Features (Optional)
- **Usage:** Enhance performance and usability.
- **Tasks:**
  - Parallel and distributed learning
  - Early stopping
  - Feature importance calculation

## Implementation Steps
1. Data binning and preprocessing
2. Implement histogram-based decision tree learner
3. Define loss functions and gradient/hessian calculations
4. Implement the boosting loop
5. Add regularization and pruning
6. Implement prediction logic
7. (Optional) Add advanced features
